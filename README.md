# odin-recipes
On 4/29/2022, I started and finished the "Odin-recipes" website project.
In this project, I mock a few recipes from the website 'www.allrecipes.com'.
You can check out my website at https://ken-ni.github.io/odin-recipes/.
Throughout the course, I may make changes as I learn new things.
Have a good day!
